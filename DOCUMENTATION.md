### Methods

#### `canInitialize(): Oneko`
> static
> since: 3.0.0

Returns `true` if an Oneko can be initialized under current conditions. An example in which this would return `false` is if the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query is set to `reduce`.

#### `draw(): Oneko`
> since: 2.3.0

Updates the Oneko element's position and image. Fires the `draw` event after completion.

#### `force(): Oneko`
> since: 3.0.0
> throws Error if Oneko cannot be initialized.

Forces an initialized Oneko object.

#### `frame(): Oneko`
> since: 2.3.0

Controls all animation logic.

#### `idle(): Oneko`
> since: 2.3.0

Controls idle animation logic (scratching, sleeping, etc.)

#### `isInitialized(): boolean`
> since: 3.0.0

Only `true` if the Oneko has been properly initialized. For example, if the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query is set to `reduce`, the Oneko will not initialize.

#### `moveTo(x: number, y: number): Oneko`
> since: 2.3.0

Sets the Oneko's target coordinates and element position.

#### `onAnimationFrame(timestamp: number): Oneko`
> since: 2.3.0

Runs every frame. Enables Oneko animations. `timestamp` is the duration since the last update.

#### `resetIdleAnimation(): Oneko`
> since: 2.3.0

Resets the idle animation.

#### `createDatabaseSourceURL(sourceName: OnekoDatabaseSource): string`
> static
> since: 3.0.0

Constructs a complete URL path to a file of a given name on the online source database.

#### `setPosition(x: number, y: number): Oneko`
> since: 2.3.0

Sets the coordinates for the Oneko element to be positioned at.

#### `setSourceDB(sourceName: OnekoDatabaseSource): Oneko`
> since: 2.1.0

Sets the source image of the Oneko element to a URL accessing the source database of Oneko PNGs (https://github.com/raynepaws/oneko_db/).

#### `setSprite(name: string, frame: number): Oneko`
> since: 2.3.0

Sets the sprite image to a given frame of a given animation.

#### `setTarget(x: number, y: number): Oneko`
> since: 1.0.0

Set the coordinates for the Oneko to run to. `x` and `y` are pixel values.

### Events

#### `draw`
> since: 1.1.0

Fires when the `draw` method is finished.

#### `startRunning`
> since: 2.0.0

Fires when the target coordinate becomes outside range, after alert animation plays.

####  `stopRunning`
> since: 2.0.0

Fires when target coordinate becomes inside range.
